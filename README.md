## FOLLOW THESE STEPS TO RUN THE TEST
- Create a folder on your local machine where you want to install cypress
- Then, install cypress in that folder by running the following command in the terminal<br>
  ### "npm install cypress --save-dev" <br>
  _*(You should have node and npm installed already. If not, just download and install node and npm from https://nodejs.org/en/download)*_
- Open the folder in your preferred text editor (VS Code or any other of your choice)
- There are some config files that necessary to run cypress and will be in the folder by default. Replace the files _*"cypress.config.js"*_ and _*"e2e.js"*_ with the ones in this zip folder
- Take the _*"assessment.cy.js"*_ file in this zip folder and place it in the *e2e Folder* where you have installed cypress

  ### "npx cypress open"

- Select the browser you want to run the tests with and click "Start E2E Testing"
