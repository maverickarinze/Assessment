## FOLLOW THESE STEPS TO RUN THE TEST
- Create a folder on your local machine where you want to install cypress
- Then, install cypress in that folder by running the following command in the terminal   return
  "npm install cypress --save-dev"\n 
  _*(You should have node and npm installed already. If not, just download and install node and npm from https://nodejs.org/en/download)*_
- Open the folder in your preferred text editor (VS Code or any other of your choice)
- There are some config files that necessary to run cypress and will be in the folder by default. Replace the files "cypress.config.js" and "e2e.js" with the ones in this zip folder

  "npx cypress open"
